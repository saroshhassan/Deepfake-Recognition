# Deepfake-Recognition
This project explores deepfake detection using CNN models trained on a subset of the Real and Synthetic Faces Dataset (Mendeley Data). It includes end-to-end preprocessing with feature extraction (Color Histogram, LBP, Edge Density), model tuning with Keras Tuner, and evaluation with recall-based early stopping. Visual analyses are also provided.
